## **Introduction**

Traditional process discovery techniques often rely solely on event logs, neglecting valuable domain knowledge and process rules. IMr bridges this gap by integrating such rules, enabling the discovery of models that are both conformant to observed behavior and aligned with expert knowledge. Key benefits include:

*   **Improved Model Quality:** Generates process models that better reflect real-world constraints and domain expertise.
*   **Enhanced Interpretability:** Creates more understandable models by incorporating explicit process rules.
*   **Increased Applicability:** Produces models that are better suited for conformance checking, performance analysis, and other process mining applications.

---

## **Features**

*   Integrates discovered or user-defined process rules into the process discovery workflow.
*   Employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, using rules to guide the selection of process structures at each recursion step.
*   Supports the discovery of high-quality imperative process models, such as BPMN models and Petri nets.
*   Evaluates the quality of discovered models based on conformance metrics and rule alignment.
*   Supports user uploads of event logs and rule sets.
